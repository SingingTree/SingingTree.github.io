title: WebM Encryption (with Clearkey): Why and How
---

Encryping WebMs: why? how? let's go:

# Encrypted Media

Back in the old days when almost everything cost a nickel and we walked up hill, in the snow, barefoot, we consumed a lot of media via Flash and Silverlight. One of reasons why these technologies have been popular for media play back: Digital Rights Management (hence forth: DRM).

## DRM Through the Ages

DRM as a concept has been around a long time. It's gone by other names (e.g. copy protection), but we've had it for quite awhile now. DVDs were scrambled ([Content Scramble System](Content Scramble System)), games had and continue to have license keys, ebooks will always have tiny watermarks used to track when you share them and earn you black marks in the ledgers of the powerful ebook cabals. We know these things.

There are a lot of debates to be had about DRM, this post isn't going to get into that. We may or may not like its existence, but we can accept that it does exist. There are currently swathes of content that will not be licensed unless protected with DRM. So, what's going on with the current DRM?

## Modern DRM (for Audio/Vido)

With the popularity of HTML 5's media elements we've seen a move away from Flash and Silverlight for media playback. However, there remained a question about DRM with these new elements.
